# plotly-challenge

This repo contains homework assignment 15 for the University of Denver's Data Analytics Bootcamp.  

For this assignment, I extracted data from a large JSON file, and created interactive visualizations in plotly using that data.  The data is about samples of bacteria taken from belly buttons.  I was provided with the JSON data, as well as a starter index.html file.  I only manipulated the index.html file to add a table tag and to comment out a script I did not use.  The bulk of the work was done in the app.js file.  Using JavaScript, I extracted data from the JSON file, created a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart.  I also populated a dropdown menu for all the different individuals who were sampled, and the visualizations change to reflect the data for each sample.
